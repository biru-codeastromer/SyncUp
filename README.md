## Ideation

### Problem Statement
Students on campus often struggle to discover and connect with clubs that match their interests. Clubs also lack a centralized, dedicated platform to manage their members, announce events, and showcase their activities, often resorting to scattered social media posts that get lost.

### Proposed Solution
SyncUp solves this by providing a one-stop-shop for campus engagement. It's a full-stack web platform connecting students with campus clubs. It allows users to view public posts, join clubs for exclusive content, create posts, engage with likes/comments, and register for events.
